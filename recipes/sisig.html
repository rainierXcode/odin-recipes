    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Sisig is a popular appetizer (pulutan) turned main dish that originated from the culinary capital of the Philippines : Pampanga. This dish was invented by Lucia Cunanan or popularly know as Aling Lucing (she is also known as the sisig queen). Originally, sisig is composed of chopped pigs face (snout included) and ears with a generous amounts of chicken liver. Hundreds of sisig variations are available today ranging from the original pigs face (maskara) ingredient to a more healthy seafood concoction such as squid, tuna, milk fish (bangus), and mussels.
